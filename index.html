      <h2>Who Was Nikola Tesla?</h2>
      <p>Nikola Tesla (July 10, 1856 to January 7, 1943) was an engineer known for designing the alternating-current
        (AC) electric system, which is still the predominant electrical system used across the world today. He also
        created the "Tesla coil," which is still used in radio technology. Born in what is now Croatia, Tesla came to
        the United States in 1884 and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several
        patent rights, including those to his AC machinery, to George Westinghouse.
